## üß† How It Works

### Communication Protocol
- Uses NRF24L01 2.4GHz wireless modules for bidirectional communication
- Data transmission format: "X,Y" (comma-separated values)
- Communication address: "00001"
- Transmission rate: Every 100ms
- Operating range: Up to 100 meters (with PA/LNA module)

### Control Logic
The system uses joystick inputs for comprehensive car control:
- **Y-axis (Forward/Backward):**
  - Value > 756: Forward movement
  - Value < 556: Backward movement
  - Values between 556-756: Dead zone (no movement)

- **X-axis (Turning):**
  - Value < 545: Turn right
  - Value > 745: Turn left
  - Values between 545-745: Dead zone (straight movement)

### Movement Patterns
1. **Forward**: Both motors rotate forward at controlled speed
2. **Backward**: Both motors rotate backward at controlled speed
3. **Pivot Right**: Left motor forward, right motor backward/stopped
4. **Pivot Left**: Right motor forward, left motor backward/stopped
5. **Forward + Turn**: Differential steering while moving forward
6. **Backward + Turn**: Differential steering while moving backward
7. **Speed Control**: PWM signals (ENA, ENB) control motor speeds

### Advanced Features
- **Variable Speed Control**: PWM-based speed regulation via ENA and ENB pins
- **Signal Timeout**: Motors stop automatically if no signal is received for 500ms
- **Dead Zone**: Prevents unwanted movements due to joystick drift
- **Serial Monitoring**: Real-time status updates for debugging
- **Power Management**: Efficient voltage regulation for stable operation
